# Rails Path and Link Helpers

## Learning Objectives

* Define and call functions in Javascript
* Explain how functions are closures in JS
  * Store and pass around functions in variables
  * Explain how scope works in Javascript functions

## Outline

### Defining and calling methods

**I do**

* Operations on different data types

* Different ways to define a function
  * var funcName = function(a, b) {};
  * function func(a,b) {};
  * Loose input arguments
  * Explicit returns

**You do**

* Write a function to accept three numbers and return their product.

* Write a function to accept an age and returns
  * true if you can vote
  * false if you cannot vote
* Write a function to accept an array and print the elements in order

**I do**

* What is hoisting?
* Demonstrate loose arguments
  * Extra arguments are ignored
  * Undefined arguments are undefined
* Difference between parentheses and no parentheses
  * Referring to a function vs...
  * Calling a function

### Scope

* Variables in the scope of the function's creation.
* Pass a function to a function as a parameter, call it inside.

**We do**

* Implement `each` in javascript
* Implement `reduce` in javascript
